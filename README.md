# Overview
This project aims to build a model to detect fraudulent transactions based on historical data. We utilize two interpretable machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, to predict fraud cases effectively and understand the model behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: Fraudulent Transactions Data. The dataset contains transactional information, such as transaction type, amount, origin and destination account balances, and labels indicating fraudulent transactions.

## Models
Logistic Regression: A linear model that predicts the probability of a transaction being fraudulent. It is simple to interpret and useful for understanding the impact of each feature on the prediction.

Decision Tree: A non-linear model that creates a tree-like structure to make decisions based on the features. It is more flexible than logistic regression and can capture complex interactions between features.
